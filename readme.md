<!-- Overview: -->
This project required us to create a login,signup,categories page,and question with answers page.
We were free to design as we wish so i went with a study app that you can login into and see the categories you need to study with flashcards for each category that has a question on it and flips to reveal the answer.

Technologies used:
-bootstrap
-css
-js
-MySql
-Nodes
-Github
-bycrpt
-React
-Api
-Json

Components:
Frontend 
backend
readme.md file 
    


Ideas for future improvents:
-An option to add more flashcards
-Option to answer the question and see if you got it wrong before flipping
